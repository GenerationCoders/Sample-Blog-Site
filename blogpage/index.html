		<p>In life you have to take the trash out, if you have trash in your life, take it out, throw it away, get rid of it, major key. They never said winning was easy. Some people can’t handle success, I can. Congratulations, you played yourself. I’m giving you cloth talk, cloth. Special cloth alert, cut from a special cloth. Congratulations, you played yourself. The weather is amazing, walk with me through the pathway of more success. Take this journey with me, Lion!</p>
		<p>Egg whites, turkey sausage, wheat toast, water. Of course they don’t want us to eat our breakfast, so we are going to enjoy our breakfast. You do know, you do know that they don’t want you to have lunch. I’m keeping it real with you, so what you going do is have lunch. Mogul talk.</p>
		<p>Surround yourself with angels, positive energy, beautiful people, beautiful souls, clean heart, angel. Lion! Life is what you make it, so let’s make it. Look at the sunset, life is amazing, life is beautiful, life is what you make it. Lion! Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started. Every chance I get, I water the plants, Lion! The key to success is to keep your head above the water, never give up.</p>
